## Why it wasn't working before:

1. Version Mismatch: The main issue was a mismatch between the Redis client version you were using (4.7.0) and the way you were trying to use it. The code was written in a style compatible with older versions (like 2.8.0), but you were using a newer version with a different API.

2. Connection Handling: In Redis client v4+, you need to explicitly connect to Redis before using it. The older versions would automatically connect.

3. Asynchronous Operations: The newer Redis client uses Promises and async/await, while the old code was using callbacks.

4. Error Handling: The original code didn't have proper error handling for connection issues.

## Now, let's go through the implementation in detail:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const redis = require("redis");
const app = express();
```
This section imports the necessary modules: Express for the web server and Redis for the database client.

```javascript
const client = redis.createClient({
  url: "redis://redis:6379",
});
```
This creates a Redis client. The URL uses "redis" as the hostname, which corresponds to the service name in your Docker Compose file.

```javascript
async function startServer() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    console.log("Connected to Redis");
```
This function is declared as async, allowing the use of await. It tries to connect to Redis and logs a success message if the connection is established.

```javascript
    const visits = await client.get("visits");
    if (visits === null) {
      await client.set("visits", 0);
    }
```
This checks if the "visits" key exists in Redis. If it doesn't (returns null), it initializes it to 0. This ensures we always have a valid number to work with.

```javascript
    app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
      const visits = await client.get("visits");
      res.send("Number of visits " + visits);
      await client.set("visits", parseInt(visits) + 1);
    });
```
This sets up the route handler for the root path ("/"). It's also async, allowing the use of await for Redis operations. It gets the current visit count, sends it as a response, and then increments it.

```javascript
    app.listen(4001, () => {
      console.log("listening on port 4001");
    });
```
This starts the Express server on port 4001.

```javascript
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error connecting to Redis:", err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```
This catch block handles any errors that occur during the server startup process, including Redis connection errors.

```javascript
startServer().catch(console.error);
```
This calls the startServer function and catches any unhandled errors.

## Key Differences from the Original:

1. Async/Await: The new implementation uses async/await throughout, which makes asynchronous code easier to read and write.

2. Explicit Connection: The client.connect() call is required in the new version.

3. Promise-based API: All Redis operations (get, set) now return Promises, which we await.

4. Error Handling: There's now proper error handling for the Redis connection and operations.

5. Initialization: We check and initialize the "visits" key at startup, ensuring it always exists.

These changes make the code compatible with the newer Redis client version, more robust in handling errors, and easier to read and maintain. The asynchronous nature also ensures that Redis operations don't block the event loop, allowing your server to handle multiple requests efficiently.
